it should include an animation
(implemented using JS) of the key yosh workflow where you say something
like:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern

And for the yo prompt above, animate typing it character by character,
since that's what the user types. And then they press enter and then you
get:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Thinking...

And then after ~0.5 sec you get:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Show the current core dump pattern configuration
pizlo@traitor:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

And then you press enter and you get:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Show the current core dump pattern configuration
pizlo@traitor:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
/var/coredumps/core.%e.%p
pizlo@traitor:~$

And then you type (again, typing animation):

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Show the current core dump pattern configuration
pizlo@traitor:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
/var/coredumps/core.%e.%p
pizlo@traitor:~$ yo what does that mean

And then you get:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Show the current core dump pattern configuration
pizlo@traitor:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
/var/coredumps/core.%e.%p
pizlo@traitor:~$ yo what does that mean
Thinking...

And then after ~1 sec you get:

pizlo@traitor:~$ yo show me the coredump pattern
Show the current core dump pattern configuration
pizlo@traitor:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
/var/coredumps/core.%e.%p
pizlo@traitor:~$ yo what does that mean
The core pattern `/var/coredumps/core.%e.%p` means:

- **Location**: Core dumps are saved to `/var/coredumps/` directory
- **Filename format**: `core.<executable_name>.<process_id>`
  - `%e` = executable filename (the program that crashed)
  - `%p` = process ID (PID) of the crashed process

So if a program called `myapp` with PID 1234 crashes, the core dump would be saved as `/var/coredumps/core.myapp.1234`.

This is a custom setup - by default, most systems either disable core dumps or save them as just `core` in the current directory. Having them organized in a dedicated directory with descriptive names makes debugging much easier!
