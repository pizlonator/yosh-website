First the user types:

pizlo@megadeth:~$ yo where is my usb stick mounted

Show the typing animation for the "yo" prompt.

Then:

pizlo@megadeth:~$ yo where is my usb stick mounted
Thinking...

Then after 0.5 sec you get:

pizlo@megadeth:~$ yo where is my usb stick mounted
Show all disks and partitions with their mount points to find your USB stick
pizlo@megadeth:~$ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -E "disk|part"

And then a delay before the user presses enter and you get:

Show all disks and partitions with their mount points to find your USB stick
pizlo@megadeth:~$ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -E "disk|part"
